##hello-mir-gles2

This is a very basic computer graphics example using the EGL, GLESv2, and
Ubuntu MIR system tools.

It combines code from Joe Groff's OpenGL tutorial with code from Daniel 
van Vugt, of Canonical Inc, from Ubuntu MIR's demos.

This allows us to explore the following:

0. Handle GL context with EGL and Ubuntu's MIR, instead of X11's GLX.

1. GLESv2 instead of 'standard' OpenGL (EGL support for 'Ordinary' 
   OpenGL is a bit of a tricky thing at the moment, mid 2014, requiring
   some special build settings that i didnt feel like looking up. also
   GLESv2 is what they are using on tablets, raspb pi, etc, so thats kinda
   cool)

2. Since GLESv2 deprecates alot of the same stuff as OpenGL3, this allows
   to test a kind of 'updated' non-deprecated GL system

3. A system without GLEW, since GLEW support for GLES and EGL is a bit
   experimental (for example, pkg-config glew will drag in -lGL and -lGLU
   which we dont want because there is no standard plain-old GLU for GLES yet)

4. Write a MIR client program without dragging in all of the other 
   extraneous build files inside of Ubuntu's 'examples' build system

##How do I build?

You need to install MIR first.

*http://unity.ubuntu.com/mir/installing_prebuilt_on_pc.html

Then you need some other tools:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config cmake

Now do this

    git clone http://github.com/donbright/hello-mir-gles2
    cd hello-mir-gles2
    mkdir bin
    cd bin
    cmake ..
    make

##MIR? how do you run this program under MIR?

See http://unity.ubuntu.com/mir/using_mir_on_pc.html

For a non-X11 do this:

* Log in to X11. Don't log out.
* Switch to VT1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1)
* $ sudo mir_demo_server_basic
* Switch to VT2 (Ctrl+Alt+F2)
* $ sudo chmod 777 /tmp/mir_socket
* $ sudo ./hello_mir_gles2
* Switch back to VT1 to watch program output (Ctrl+Alt+F1)
* Switch back to VT2, its probably corrupted now
* Switch back to X11 to clear screen (alt-right, alt-right, repeatedly)

##does it work properly?

Not quite. You can get an image on screen, but it doesn't transform like 
Joe's example in 'ordinary' OpenGL 3.0.

##But I ran ldd on the binary and it shows its linked to X??? I thought this was supposed to be X-free?

EGL shipping with Ubuntu currently is linked to X. (mid-2014). For Proof 
run this:

    for i in `find /usr/lib/ | grep EGL.so`;
      do echo "---------" $i; ldd $i;
    done

##what about Wayland and Weston, they can be used to draw EGL without X11 too?

This is possible, but I gave up trying after having some problems trying
to build the Weston examples without building all of Weston.. and then
failing to build all of Weston due to the following breakage of backwards
compatability:

https://www.mail-archive.com/wayland-devel@lists.freedesktop.org/msg14995.html

It can be done, i will leave it for another time, or for another person to do.
